                                        the body is awareness, the wings are freedom and love, the journey is the un-known, 
                                        and the outcome is joy and laughter! (Lama)
                                        Ever since he was young, Lama always wondered about the nature of human beings,
                                         where they come from and where they go! Through-out the journey of living on planet earth,
                                          through-in the experience of meditation within himself Lama has been content and fulfilled.
                                         His attitude towered living is: Empty yourself! Let go! Let be! Laugh!

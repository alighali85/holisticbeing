                            In the late 20th century and early 21st century self-help, holistic health, and spiritual healing topics occupied a very advance stage in the collective consciousness of not only health professionals and providers, but also all humans. Individuals including health professionals and practitioners are awakening into the new realm, previously known and practiced by ancient cultures, of self-help knowledge and holistic healing awareness.

                            A human being is a whole of body, mind, soul, spirit and connections orchestrated energies played ecstatically within the symphony of existence where he is the experienced maestro and not a mere player in his own earth life. When any part of these coordinated dynamics is unbalanced, his health will suffer and the whole person will be dysfunctional at some level, which will eventually affect other levels of his being</p><br><br>
                            <p class="hb__text--h3">
                                    Most people feel guilty for having negative emotions and blame themselves for what they consider negative behavior patterns. Lots of energy is lost in such a fight. With better understanding, reflection, and meditation they can begin to witness these patterns and their roots in the subconscious mind and bring into light new transformation and growth.</p><br><br>
                                    <p class="hb__text--h3">
                                            Helping oneself, solving one’s health problems, and healing one’s life as a whole goes as far as the history of humankind goes and proved to be of crucial importance to the lives of individuals and societies. In our experience, individually centered self-help holistic health approach, which integrates therapies from traditional western medicine with complementary and alternative medicine can provide a remarkable solution for challenges which are currently facing individuals, groups, and health systems around the world</p><br><br>

                        In mindfulness the mind is completely attending to what is happening at the present moment, 
                        watching with calm and acceptance feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensation when they arise.<br><br>

                        Mindful eating means being fully attentive to our food at all time from choosing and buying to preparing and serving till consuming and digesting.<br><br>
                        This has tremendous proven results not only on the physical body but also on mind, feeling,
                        emotions and overall health. In addition to craving control and weight management some benefits include the development of satisfaction,
                        trust, love and positive thinking in ones self, feelings and actions.<br><br>
                        In this course we combine ancient wisdom with modern nutrition and current scientific research, not only to answer questions such as what to eat but to be more conscious about how, how much, why, when, where and with whom we eat.
                        Important topics such as vegetarianism, dieting, and food supplements are covered.<br><br>
                        <strong>Layout: </strong>Questions and information on mindfulness in general and mindful eating in particular and related challenges and difficulties are discussed.

                            Holistic Health is actually an approach to life. Rather than focusing on illness or specific parts of the body, 
                            this ancient approach to health considers the whole person and how he or she interacts with his or her environment. Details...

                                    Traditional meditations are passive and require us to sit still in silence to achieve a meditative state that can help us in our active life.<br> But this is difficult for modern man who experiences high levels of stress,

                                    On the other hand, active meditation in which movement and silence are involved, have been designed to enable us to consciously express and experience repressed feelings and emotions, and develop the ability of watching our thoughts and habitual patterns in a new way. It is more practical for the modern world.<br>
                                    Examples of active meditations are Nadabrahma, Nataraj, Dynamic and Kundalini..<br><br>

                                    This course provides new insights about the nature of the mind, opportunity to meet with other like-minded people, and inspirations on relationships. We achieve:<br>
                                    · Improved immune system, concentration and over all health.<br>
                                    · Deep relaxation, inner peace and silence for days after the meditation.<br>
                                    · Better stress management and freedom from habits and addictions.<br>
                                    · Increased ability to let go, laugh, and live with joy<br><br>
                                    <strong>Instructions: </strong>
                                    Kundalini meditation is one hour long (four stages of 15 minutes) and best practised in the late afternoon or at sunset. <br>
                                    The first two stages, shaking and dancing, help in moving repressed and blocked energies. When that energy flows dance becomes a total joy. The last two stages, sitting and laying down, enable all this energy to move upwards into silence.<br>
                                     It is a very effective way of letting go at the end of the day.<br><br>

                                <strong>Layout: </strong>Questions, information on meditations, challenges and difficulties are discussed in the first half hour,
                                 then one hour of Kundalini active meditation of four stages is explained and practiced.
